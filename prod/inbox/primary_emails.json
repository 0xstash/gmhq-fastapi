That's exactly what caught my eye, because\r\nwe're tackling a similar challenge in product support.\r\n\r\nWhile you're revolutionizing sales with AI, we're transforming product\r\nsupport with an ambient AI that actually learns from user behavior - no\r\ntraining or maintenance needed. Just a few lines of code and it starts\r\nunderstanding how users interact with your product.\r\n\r\nCompanies like Smokeball saw their support NPS jump from 60 to 77 with a\r\n92% successful self-service rate. Their support team now focuses on\r\nstrategic work instead of repetitive questions.\r\n\r\nWant to see how it works?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDaniel\r\n",

You can even tag one of the\r\n>>    research columns in this prompt, but that's an extra the AI has some of\r\n>>    that context from the email anyway\r\n>>    - There's a bug in minute 12 (which we will fix ASAP).
