To: <hussein@godmodehq.com> Hi Hussein, Saw you're building the future of AI-native sales at GodmodeHQ - making outbound feel like inbound. That's exactly what caught my eye, because we're tackling a similar challenge in product support. While you're revolutionizing sales with AI, we're transforming product support with an ambient AI that actually learns from user behavior - no training or maintenance needed. Just a few lines of code and it starts understanding how users interact with your product. Companies like Smokeball saw their support NPS jump from 60 to 77 with a 92% successful self-service rate. Their support team now focuses on strategic work instead of repetitive questions. Want to see how it works? Thanks, Daniel",
