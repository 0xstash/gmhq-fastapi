You can even tag one of the\r\n>>    research columns in this prompt, but that's an extra the AI has some of\r\n>>    that context from the email anyway\r\n>>    - There's a bug in minute 12 (which we will fix ASAP).

Awesome first draft, really great work.\r\n>\r\n> I've added some more credits to your account as promised.\r\n>\r\n> Here are some comments I have on the video:\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>    - Intro/preview could show off AI research or message personalisation\r\n>    vs leads search. What do you think?\r\n>    - When you show the email column in minute 4, some of the rows are not\r\n>    enriched. You mention for tech stack that if you enrich, the missing data\r\n>    will populate, but I think it's also important to mention it for emails\r\n>    - For the 3rd AI research column that you run (the one named\r\n>    \"research\"), you don't have to paste the value props there any more. I know\r\n>    that's what I showed you in the demo video, but we've since fixed that so\r\n>    that the info in GTM settings is taken as context by the AI anyway. Also,\r\n>    maybe you can rename that column to \"pain points\" instead of \"research\"?\r\n>    - I think you did a great job with the outbound prompt, but it's\r\n>    important to tell the AI to use 5th grade language, include a line break\r\n>    after each sentence, use the simplest language possible and output 50 words\r\n>    max\r\n>    - For the LinkedIn prompt, I think we are better off writing our own\r\n>    prompt rather than using the prompt library. We can tag the column with the\r\n>    outbound email saying \"I just sent this email (tagging the outbound column\r\n>    here) to the lead 5 days ago. Write a follow-up on LinkedIn that is maximum\r\n>    20 words\". Something along the lines of that. You can even tag one of the\r\n>    research columns in this prompt, but that's an extra the AI has some of\r\n>    that context from the email anyway\r\n>    - There's a bug in minute 12 (which we will fix ASAP). But, when you\r\n>    ran the first AI research column for the rest of the rows in the list, you\r\n>    had \"generate outreach\" selected as the purpose of the AI column and not\r\n>    \"AI research\". So, the rest of the rows populate with outbound messages,\r\n>    not research.\r\n>    - In min 13, when you are building the follow-up email, if you just\r\n>    select a sender, the subject is autopopulated to be the same as the subject\r\n>    of the initial email. No need to write another subject.\r\n>    - It would be good to write a manual follow up like the one in the\r\n>    image below, to show this capability\r\n>    - If you rebuild this campaign as you re-record this part, you should\r\n>    see that \"sent with GMHQ\" has disappeared.

Awesome first draft, really great work.\r\n\r\nI've added some more credits to your account as promised.\r\n\r\nHere are some comments I have on the video:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Intro/preview could show off AI research or message personalisation vs leads search. What do you think?\r\n  *   When you show the email column in minute 4, some of the rows are not enriched. You mention for tech stack that if you enrich, the missing data will populate, but I think it's also important to mention it for emails\r\n  *   For the 3rd AI research column that you run (the one named \"research\"), you don't have to paste the value props there any more. I know that's what I showed you in the demo video, but we've since fixed that so that the info in GTM settings is taken as context by the AI anyway. Also, maybe you can rename that column to \"pain points\" instead of \"research\"?\r\n  *   I think you did a great job with the outbound prompt, but it's important to tell the AI to use 5th grade language, include a line break after each sentence, use the simplest language possible and output 50 words max\r\n  *   For the LinkedIn prompt, I think we are better off writing our own prompt rather than using the prompt library. We can tag the column with the outbound email saying \"I just sent this email (tagging the outbound column here) to the lead 5 days ago. Write a follow-up on LinkedIn that is maximum 20 words\". Something along the lines of that. You can even tag one of the research columns in this prompt, but that's an extra the AI has some of that context from the email anyway\r\n  *   There's a bug in minute 12 (which we will fix ASAP). But, when you ran the first AI research column for the rest of the rows in the list, you had \"generate outreach\" selected as the purpose of the AI column and not \"AI research\". So, the rest of the rows populate with outbound messages, not research.\r\n  *   In min 13, when you are building the follow-up email, if you just select a sender, the subject is autopopulated to be the same as the subject of the initial email. No need to write another subject.\r\n  *   It would be good to write a manual follow up like the one in the image below, to show this capability\r\n  *   If you rebuild this campaign as you re-record this part, you should see that \"sent with GMHQ\" has disappeared. Lmk if this is not the case, since we don't want this in the video.\r\n\r\nI hope this hasn't added too much work for you. Thanks a lot for your work and speed so far, I really love this as a first draft.\r\n\r\n[CleanShot 2024-11-06 at 12.38.44.png]\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n[https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/mail-sig/AIorK4xy1sEIgxKa25B9Mng39y4Auf3JDc48h9gQfkRGaD1ArhJxOiAMp8rDG1lyrMAAu-x7VzkGh_jjFo8e]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Nov 6, 2024 at 7:27 AM Nate Herkelman <nateherk@uppitai.com<mailto:nateherk@uppitai.com>> wrote:\r\nHey Hussein,\r\n\r\nWill create a thumbnail and a video description tomorrow, but wanted to get you the unlisted video ASAP.\r\n\r\nHere it is: https://youtu.be/ESCS1DHyd-A\r\n\r\nIt went over 10 minutes, but I wanted to make sure I explained the interface and the steps I took.

Then when I individually run that row again sometimes it will come through, but sometimes it doesn't. Any advice here?\r\n\r\nThis tool is all around so awesome though, and so cool to see what it can do.
