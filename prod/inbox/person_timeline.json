On the balance sheet , the payment to contractors appears as a payable (for the last month). To confirm the same , we generally send an email to the contractor/employee to confirm the payable. Further , it is a general audit procedure in order to confirm the existence of the employees/contractors.

          "description": "Hi Mert,\n\nI am putting some time in the calendar for your 24-month review meeting which is a mandatory requirement of your visa.\n\nPlease complete the attached spreadsheet and return it by Thursday, 23 January 2025.\n\nPlease briefly backfill the spreadsheet to demonstrate progress made so far (0- 24 months), and then complete the rest of the document listing forecasts for the remainder of the visa (24-months onwards).\n\nThe purpose of the meeting is to check in and find out what has happened since your visa was issued, how your plans may have changed, and what you hope to achieve in the coming 6 months.\n\nWe would therefore like you to come prepared to talk about your experience in the last 12 months, the challenges you have experienced and how you have and/or plan to overcome them. We will also cover the next 6 months – what that looks like in terms of recruitment, customers, investment etc. and, if appropriate, why that differs from the initial business plan that you submitted as part of your application. Some founders find it useful to summarise their journey with a presentation.\n\nWe have allowed 30 minutes, but we don’t expect it to take that long.\n\nWe look forward to speaking with you.\n\nBest wishes,\nGaby\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\nMicrosoft Teams Need help?<https://aka.ms/JoinTeamsMeeting?omkt=en-US>\nJoin the meeting now<https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_Mzk1YTQzZGEtM2ExNC00NzIxLWE1ODItYjA5ZjQ2YTJkYTA5%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%228fa217ec-33aa-46fb-ad96-dfe68006bb86%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%2282992306-09fc-4d82-afc0-164b0e4b3806%22%7d>\nMeeting ID: 358 372 652 409\nPasscode: Nf26Mw6U\n________________________________\nDial in by phone\n+44 20 7660 8305,,799725570#<tel:+442076608305,,799725570> United Kingdom, City of London\nFind a local number<https://dialin.teams.microsoft.com/644b41cc-0dd9-4666-8573-930138710980?id=799725570>\nPhone conference ID: 799 725 570#\nFor organizers: Meeting options<https://teams.microsoft.com/meetingOptions/?organizerId=82992306-09fc-4d82-afc0-164b0e4b3806&tenantId=8fa217ec-33aa-46fb-ad96-dfe68006bb86&threadId=19_meeting_Mzk1YTQzZGEtM2ExNC00NzIxLWE1ODItYjA5ZjQ2YTJkYTA5@thread.v2&messageId=0&language=en-US> | Reset dial-in PIN<https://dialin.teams.microsoft.com/usp/pstnconferencing>\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\n",
