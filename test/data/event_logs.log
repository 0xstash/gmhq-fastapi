<ideal_customer_profile>
<company_size_revenue>
<reasoning>
From the website content and pricing page information, GodmodeHQ targets businesses with significant operational scale that need automation. The pricing page specifically mentions "Mid-sized businesses with $10M+ revenue" as their target segment. The tool's enterprise features and integration capabilities suggest it's designed for companies with established processes and systems.
</reasoning>
<attribute>
