Subject: Quick Follow-Up: Sustainable Swag Insights

Hey Eric,

I was digging into sustainable enterprise swag trends and something clicked about BetterSwag's potential. 

Noticed your team is doing some fascinating work bridging sustainability with corporate gifting - there's a massive untapped market for companies wanting authentic, eco-friendly branded merchandise.

Would you be open to a 15-minute chat where I share some unexpected market research I've uncovered about scaling sustainable swag strategies?

Cheers,
Mert
