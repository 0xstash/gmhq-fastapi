Subject: Quick Idea for BetterSwag's Sales

Hey Eric,

I noticed BetterSwag is ramping up digital transformation, and I think I spotted a way to supercharge your sales outreach. Your recent push into sustainable swag is awesome, but I'm guessing tracking down the right enterprise clients is a grind.

We've built AI that can basically do your prospect research and initial outreach - finding companies that actually care about sustainable branded merch, not just talking about it. Imagine having a digital sales assistant that understands your mission and can connect you with brands that genuinely align.

Want to see how this could save your team tons of time? I'm happy to walk you through a quick demo.

Cheers,
Mert
